  title: Consultation
  description: Upon visiting the hospital, a patient will be required to pick a ticket that helps to provide services on a first-come, first-served basis. At the reception desk, staff will guide patients through patient services and provide advice according to needs.  The triage is the first clinical contact point where vitals are taken before consulting the doctor (Senior House Officer). Following a consultation, the doctor will refer patients to the relevant diagnostic department (laboratory, radiology or to the pharmacy).
